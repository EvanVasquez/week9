# Web-Security-Week9

# Project 9 - Honeypot

Time spent: **19** hours spent in total

> Objective: Learn about Network Security by attacking and being attacked at vulnarable networked resources. Multiple Honey Pot VM instances were created to demonstrate it. 

## Which HoneyPot(s) you deployed 
  - mhn-honeypot-1 : dionaea
  - mhn-honeypot-2 : conpot
  - mhn-honeypot-3 : snort
  - mhn-honeypot-4 : dionaea

## Any issues you encountered
  > My biggest issue was getting access to the ip web app that MHN sets up for you. I had to spend several days to find another way to do it. 

## A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc.
1. Google Cloud and Honeypot GIF setup
    - I used Google Cloud to set up a VM using Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 . I cloned a git repository and installed MHN. This VM will be the Admin while the other 4 VM will be the Honeypots to attack.
    - I created 2 dionaea Honeypots, 1 snort Honeypot, and 1 conpot Honeypot.
